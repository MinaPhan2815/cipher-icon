### Customize Icon Mapping
The application utilizes an icon map that associates each character with a corresponding emoji icon. This mapping allows for seamless encoding of text inputs into emoji icons and vice versa. Below is an example snippet of the icon map used in the application

```javascript
const iconMap = {
  'a': 'üêΩ',
  'b': 'üëÄ',

  // Add more mappings as needed...
};
```
You can customize the icon mappings according to your preferences or add additional characters and corresponding icons to extend the functionality of the application.
